# Data-Storytelling-On-Why-USA-Is-Most-Affected-Country-By-Covid-19-Using-Tableau-Desktop
In this Data Story telling we have used Covid-19 intial data set from begining of Covid-19 till April 2020 to find reansons for why USA is most affected by Covid-19 through Tableau Desktop where I have created different types of charts which helped me to give proofs for all reasons on why USA is most affected than other country.My main aim was exploring Tableau Desktop storytelling,visualization and dashboard funcationality through this small data storytelling project on Covid-19 Dataset.Details about dataset and descriptions you can find Below.

### Things you will find in tableau file:

1. Different charts
2. Dashboards
3. Data Strory

### Important Note:

* Why USA is most Affected country by Covid-19 which we are trying to show through our tableau visualization ,storytelling and dashboards is based upon data that we have taken till 7th April 2020 for COVID–19 world wide and 4th April 2020 for USA. Numbers will be change after these dates and will increase only across the world.

### Data Sets:

* In order to do Data Story telling on Covid-19 we have used three different data sets and they can be found below:

1. Covid-19 daily cases and deaths worldwide dataset(31 Dec 2019 To 07 Apr 2020).
Link To Dataset : https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/publications-data/download-todays-data-geographic-distribution-covid-19-cases-worldwide

2. USA County cases and deaths dataset(21 Jan 2020 To 04 Apr 2020).
Link To Dataset : https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data.

3. International tourism number of arrivals dataset.
Link To Dataset: https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/international-tourism-number-of-arrivals

### Data Pre-Processing:

* USA County data and international tourism number of arrivals data we collected directly from provided link just by downloading excel files and  for Covid-19 data it was in raw text form so followed below steps to clean it:

1. Copy raw text data in excel file.
2. Select whole data go to Data tab from Data Tools option select Text to Column option Follow process choose comma for delimiter.
3. After completing above step we got our whole separated data.
4. One of column few  values having special symbols removed them by find and replace.	

### Tableau For Pre-Processing:

* Since our all data were totally different from each other we didn’t require any pre-processing to do in tableau with dataset and we didn’t join any because every data is different from other.
* We just rename some of column name like for Covid-19 data we changed countries and territories column to Country Day Date to Date and like wise.
