# Data Storytelling On How COVID Started and Why USA Is Most Affected Country By Covid-19 Using Tableau Desktop
In this Data Story telling we have used Covid-19 intial data set from the begining of Covid-19 till April 2020. To find the reansons that why the USA is most affected Countey by Covid-19 across the world. With the help of Tableau Desktop where I have created different types of charts, dashboards and data story which show the reasons that why USA is more affected than all other countries. My main aim was exploring Tableau Desktop storytelling, visualization and dashboard funcationality through this small data storytelling project on Covid-19 Dataset. Details about dataset and descriptions you can find below.

### PS: I have tried to make a dashboard which looks the one created by the Johns Hopkins University.

### Things you will find in tableau file:

1. Different charts
2. Dashboards
3. Data Strory

### Important Note:

* Why USA is most Affected country by Covid-19 which we are trying to show through our tableau visualization ,storytelling and dashboards is based upon data which we have used i.e till 7th April 2020 for COVIDâ€“19 world wide and 4th April 2020 for USA. Numbers will be change after these dates and will only increase across the world.

### Data Sets:

* In order to do Data Story telling on Covid-19 we have used three different data sets and they can be found below:

1. Covid-19 daily cases and deaths worldwide dataset(31 Dec 2019 To 07 Apr 2020).
Link To Dataset : https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/publications-data/download-todays-data-geographic-distribution-covid-19-cases-worldwide

2. USA County cases and deaths dataset(21 Jan 2020 To 04 Apr 2020).
Link To Dataset : https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data.

3. International tourism number of arrivals dataset.
Link To Dataset: https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/international-tourism-number-of-arrivals

### Data Pre-Processing:

* USA County data and international tourism number of arrivals data we collected directly from provided link just by downloading excel files and for Covid-19 data it was in raw text form so followed below steps to clean it:

1. Copy raw text data in excel file.
2. Select whole data then go to Data tab then from Data Tools option select Text to Column option Follow process choose comma for delimiter.
3. After completing above step we got our whole separated data.
4. One column with few values having special symbols has been removed by find and replace.	

### Tableau For Pre-Processing:

* Since our all datasets were totally different from each other, we do not require to perform any data pre-processing in tableau and we have not joined the datasets as well because every dataset was different from other.
* We just renamed some of the column name like for Covid-19 data we changed countries and territories column to Country Day Date to Date and like wise.
